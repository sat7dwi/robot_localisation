# Harmonic Search Based Algorithms For Mobile Robot Localization
EE698 mobile robotics course project

For a mobile Robot to be autonomous, it first needs to have confidence of its own position with respect to environment. 
In this project we implement two novel algorithms that could be used to efficiently localize an autonomous bot
having range only sensors like lidars. The algorithms are based on Harmony search algorithm which is a meta heuristic
optimization algorithm. We used Harmony search algorithm to perform scan matching of the measurements with the pre-saved
map to get accurate pose of the robot. We also implemented SLAM based on the above algorithms.
